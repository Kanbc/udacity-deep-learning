    "Open the iPython notebook for this assignment ([4_convolutions.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/4_convolutions.ipynb)), and follow the instructions to implement and run each indicated step. Some steps have been implemented for you.\n",

    "This is a self-evaluated assignment. As you go through the notebook, make sure you are able to solve each problem and answer any posed questions (save your responses as markdown in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the model by experimenting with its structure - how many layers, how they are connected, stride, pooling, etc. For more efficient training, try applying techniques such as dropout and learning rate decay. What does your final architecture look like?"
