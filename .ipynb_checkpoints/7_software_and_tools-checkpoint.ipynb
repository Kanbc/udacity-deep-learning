    "#### Install TensorFlow on your computer**\n",
    "Follow the instructions to download and setup TensorFlow. Choose one of the three ways to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pip**: Install TensorFlow directly on your computer. You need to have Python 2.7 or 3.x and pip installed; and this may impact other Python packages that you may have.\n",
    "- **Virtualenv**: Install TensorFlow in an isolated (virtual) Python environment. You need to have Python 2.7 or 3.x and virtualenv installed; this will not affect Python packages in any other environment.\n",
    "- **Docker**: Run TensorFlow in an isolated Docker container (virtual machine) on your computer. You need to have Vagrant, Docker and virtualization software like VirtualBox installed; this will keep TensorFlow completely isolated from the rest of your computer, but may require more memory to run.\n",
